abstract = {Scaling is an integral component of ecology and earth science. To date, the ability to determine the importance of air–water gas exchange across large spatial scales is hampered partly by our ability to scale the gas transfer velocity and stream hydraulics. Here we report on a metadata analysis of 563 direct gas tracer release experiments that examines scaling laws for the gas transfer velocity. We found that the gas transfer velocity scales with the product of stream slope and velocity, which is in alignment with theory on stream energy dissipation. In addition to providing equations that predict the gas transfer velocity based on stream hydraulics, we used our hydraulic data set to report a new set of hydraulic exponents and coefficients that allow the prediction of stream width, depth, and velocity based on discharge. Finally, we report a new table of gas Schmidt number dependencies to allow researchers to estimate a gas transfer velocity using our equation for many gasses of interest.},

@article{Vannote1980,
abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a continuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream communities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjustments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a framework for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implications of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.Key words: river continuum; stream ecosystems; ecosystem structure, function; resource partitioning; ecosystem stability; community succession; river zonation; stream geomorphology},

abstract = {The processes and biomass that characterize any ecosystem are fundamentally constrained by the total amount of energy that is either fixed within or delivered across its boundaries. Ultimately, ecosystems may be understood and classified by their rates of total and net productivity and by the seasonal patterns of photosynthesis and respiration. Such understanding is well developed for terrestrial and lentic ecosystems but our understanding of ecosystem phenology has lagged well behind for rivers. The proliferation of reliable and inexpensive sensors for monitoring dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide is underpinning a revolution in our understanding of the ecosystem energetics of rivers. Here, we synthesize our current understanding of the drivers and constraints on river metabolism, and set out a research agenda aimed at characterizing, classifying and modeling the current and future metabolic regimes of flowing waters.},

Whole-ecosystem metabolism is an important indicator of the role of organic matter, C cycling, and trophic structure in rivers. Ecosystem metabolism is well studied in small streams, but less is known about metabolism in large rivers. We estimated daily whole-ecosystem metabolism over 2 y for 1 site each at the Mississippi and Chattahoochee Rivers in the USA to understand factors influencing temporal patterns of ecosystem metabolism. We estimated rates of gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR), and net ecosystem production (NEP) with a curve-fitting approach with publicly available discharge (Q), dissolved O 2 , temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data. Models were run for week-long blocks, and power analyses suggested that rates should be established at least once for each 10-wk period throughout the year to characterize annual rates of metabolism accurately in these 2 rivers. We analyzed weekly rates averaged over 10-wk periods with Spearman rank correlation to identify potential drivers and with path analyses to identify interactions among variables driving GPP, CR, and NEP. Both rivers had an overall negative NEP, and the Mississippi River had stronger seasonal trends. In the Mississippi River, CR was strongly positively correlated with Q, which suggests variation in seasonal availability of allochthonous C. In the Chattahoochee, CR was most strongly positively correlated with GPP, whereas GPP was negatively correlated with Q, which suggests that autochthonous processes and water-column light attenuation played important roles in C dynamics. Our results suggest that these large rivers were net heterotrophic at annual time scales but autotrophy can be important seasonally.},
