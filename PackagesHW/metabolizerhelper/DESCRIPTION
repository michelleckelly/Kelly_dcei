Title: Helper package for piping to streamMetabolizer and generating pretty plots 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Michelle Catherine Kelly
Maintainer: Michelle Catherine Kelly <michellekelly@ku.edu>
Description: This package is designed to format a limited dataset of stream discharge, dissolved oxygen, 
	and temperature data for stream metabolism modeling, using the streamMetabolizer package. 
	metabolizerhelper approximates PAR based on latitude and time using functions within streamMetabolizer, 
	if PAR is not provided. This package accomplishes similar goals as the streamPULSE package project, 
	and users are encouraged to explore streamPULSE for wider functionality (although they will have to 
	rely on metabolizerhelper for pretty plotting). This package was developed for a class assignment.
